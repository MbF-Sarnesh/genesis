									<h4>Engine halting at the middle of the road or not starting at all</h4>
									<div class="accordion-content">
									<p>Usually one can experience a problem during the cold start of a bike, especially if it is being started after a certain period of delay. There can be various reasons for this. The most common reason can be engine is not getting sufficient fuel to start which now takes us to the carburetor ( as it is still widely used in our bikes).

									A simple choke can help you in starting it. If the problems still follow then check your fuel line. Another reason can be bad quality fuel which I am sure almost all the bikers have faced. If there is no problem there then you will like to take a look at the spark plugs, what their condition is, whether you are getting enough spark to run the engine. If still it doesn’t start up, then buddy I afraid you have a problem in the coil or engine which in most cases will need assistance of a mechanic.

									If you are experiencing a halt in the middle of a long run then first park your bike in a safe place. Now look for the fuel line, see if there is any problem there. The quality of fuel also matters here. If you are riding a lower cc bike at a constant high speed then engine may over heat & stop. Give her some time to cool things up. If it has point system then you should check the plugs & if your bike has a CDI ignition then you should check whether its getting sufficient amount of current it needs.
									</p> 
									</div>
									</div>
									<div class="accordion-row-blk">
									<h4> Not Getting A Good Throttle Response</h4>
									<div class="accordion-content">
									<p> If you are not getting a good throttle response then there are couple of things you can check for. For instance first thing will be the carburetor tuning along with the engine tuning. Check for the air filter, fuel filter & the spark plugs. If the problem still persists then you should check the quality of the fuel too. Now these are the major things you should check for first.

									To make your observation vaster you can also check the spark or the CDI or the coils whether they are providing enough sparks at the right time. You can also check your acceleration cable. We often forget about it but as time passes by, rusts start building inside the cable as it is prone to open air. You can also check whether your clutch plates are ok or not.

									<h4>Motorcycle Braking Problems</h4>
									<div class="accordion-content">
									<p>I believe this is the most essential part of any moving vehicle. I remember when I first learnt to drive a car, my uncle taught me, it is not about how fast you can go, it is about how smoothly you can brake even cruising at a very high speed. In our country we have two kinds of brakes. One is Drum brakes & the other is Disk brakes which r controlled by Hydraulic fuel. Lets talk about Drum brakes first. If you are facing a problem in braking system then the first thing you need to see is the brake cable. If it is old, change it. It may rust inside & tangle when you are braking thus not providing good support. You should monitor the brake pads regularly. If you are using drum brakes then I will suggest not to ride aggressively when you are riding for a very long time. More braking means the pads will get hotter & expand more which can result in poor braking. Check for the brake drums as they can wear & tear with daily riding thanks to our climate.

									In disk brakes, first of all check for the Hydraulic fuel, whether its reaching the drums properly. Use only recommended fuel. Also check the buckets in the levers. Give the break shoes a regular checking.
									</p>
									</div>
									</div>
									<div class="accordion-row-blk">
									<h4>Strong Vibrations or Jerking At Top Speed</h4>
									<div class="accordion-content">
									<p>Almost all bikes have a minimum vibration which I am sure you are aware of. But if your bike is having an excessive amount of vibrations then there can be couple of things you can look for as it heavily affect your riding capabilities, specially when riding at a high speed. First of all, you should check whether all the bike’s body parts are properly joined or not, specially if it is a Chinese full faired bike.
										
One point I will like to note here is, one should check the seat bolts whether they are properly bolted. This is something we don’t check a lot but it can really hamper a good ride. We can also check the shock absorbers & the suspensions whether they are properly working or not. If they are oil based suspensions then check for the oil level. Another reason can be a worn out chain sprocket or the whole chain set which results a wobbling effect. My personal advice will be, if you are going to just change the chain, then try to change the whole set because it will give your chain a longer life time.
